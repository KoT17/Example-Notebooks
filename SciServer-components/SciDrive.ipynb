    "SciServer Compute can talk to other components of SciServer through a series of <em>modules</em>, one for each component. This example notebook shows how to use the <strong><code>SciServer.SciDrive</code></strong> module to access and manage any data that you have stored in your SciDrive space at <a href=\"http://www.scidrive.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.scidrive.org</a> (link opens in a new window). If you do not yet have any data in your SciDrive and you'd like to try this example, just find or create a simple CSV (comma-separated value) file and drag it into SciDrive to upload.\n",

Please do not edit this notebook directly, because your edits may be overwritten if changes to the SciServer modules require changes to these example notebooks.\n",
